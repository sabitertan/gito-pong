This is a Vite JavaScript browser game project. The main game is a multi-level Pong clone with:
- Modern, clean, and beginner-friendly JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Dynamic play area (50% of screen)
- Oval paddles, animated ball, and visible walls
- 10 levels with increasing AI difficulty and ball speed
- 80s-style chiptune music (changes each level) and sound effects
- Fun, glowing prompts between levels and on win, with a restart option
- All UI and game logic in `src/main.js`, styles in `src/style.css`

When generating code:
- Use simple, readable JavaScript and clear comments
- Prefer vanilla DOM and Canvas API
- Keep all game logic in `main.js` unless otherwise specified
- Use beginner-friendly patterns and avoid complex abstractions
- Add comments for any non-obvious logic or math
- Use playful, colorful UI elements for prompts and overlays
- Do not use external libraries unless requested
- Ensure all features work smoothly in a browser
