# Vite Vanilla JavaScript Game Project

This project was scaffolded using Vite with the vanilla JavaScript template. It is intended as a starting point for a simple browser-based game using modern, clean JavaScript.

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. **Open your browser:**
   Visit the local server URL shown in your terminal (usually http://localhost:5173).

## Project Structure
- `index.html`: Main HTML file.
- `main.js`: Entry point for your game logic.
- `style.css`: Styles for your game.

## Next Steps
- Replace the contents of `main.js` with your game logic.
- Use simple, beginner-friendly code and clear comments.
